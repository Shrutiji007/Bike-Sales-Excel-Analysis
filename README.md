## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights

### 1️⃣ Income vs Bike Purchase
- Customers who **did not purchase bikes** have a higher average income than buyers.
- Indicates that bike purchases are driven more by **lifestyle and commute needs** than income alone.

### 2️⃣ Age Bracket Analysis
- **Middle-aged customers** represent the largest segment of bike buyers.
- Adolescents and older age groups show significantly lower purchase counts.
- This group is the **primary target demographic**.

### 3️⃣ Commute Distance Impact
- Customers commuting **0–5 miles** are most likely to purchase bikes.
- Purchase likelihood declines as commute distance increases beyond 5 miles.

### 4️⃣ Demographic Segmentation
The dashboard allows dynamic filtering by:
- Marital Status
- Region
- Education Level
- Age Bracket

This enables fast, scenario-based customer analysis.
